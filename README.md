**Program**: Constructor Academy – Data Science & AI Bootcamp  
**Partner**: Constructor Tech

## Project Overview
This repository contains our capstone project implementing **agentic content generation** with the **Claude Code SDK**.  
We aim to build a **multi-agent system** that creates a complete **course outline with content** in one run, using:
- **Task planning**
- **Subagents**
- **Course structure representation in the file system**

The work is guided by **Albin** and **Ekaterina** and is aligned with Constructor Tech’s all-in-one platform for **research, education, and sports** (ERP, LMS, predictive game analytics, self-driving racing cars, sponsorship retention, safety & compliance).

## Goal
Implement an agentic system (Claude Code SDK) that generates a **full course outline including content** in one go.

**Required features**
- Agentic task planning
- Subagents (generator/reviewer roles)
- Persistent course structure mirrored in the file system

---

## Milestones
1. **Claude Code SDK familiarization**
   - Basic workflow
   - Extension/config points: **tools, rules, subagents**
   - Running from the SDK
2. **Basic multi-agent system**
   - Creates initial course outline
3. **Content generator agent(s)**
   - Populate modules/lessons with learning content
4. **Review/critique agent(s)**
   - Quality checks, alignment with specs, iterative refinement

---

## Data & Inputs
- **Course storage format specification**
- **Input specification** (e.g., target audience, prerequisites, outcomes)
- **Instructional expert knowledge**
  - Instructions, task descriptions
  - Review/QA criteria as prompt snippets
- **Input learning material** (source docs the agents will use)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Claude Code SDK**
- **Python** (SDK integration & orchestration)
- **Git / GitLab** for version control
