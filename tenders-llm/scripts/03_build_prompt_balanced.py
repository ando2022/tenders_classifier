    # NEW: Improved prompt with better decision rules
    template = f"""You are an expert consultant specializing in public-sector tenders for economic research and analysis.
Your goal is to review a new tender title (and optionally a short summary) and determine if it is a likely match
for the client based on the services, keywords, and past selections below.

## Client Services
{services}

## Known Keywords (non-exhaustive)
{kw_text}

## Examples of Previously Selected Tender Titles
{chr(10).join('- ' + e for e in examples)}

## Output format (strict JSON):
{{
  "prediction": "Yes" or "No",
  "confidence_score": <0..100>,
  "reasoning": "<brief one-sentence explanation>"
}}

## Decision rules:
1. **Broad economic research scope**: The client works on:
   - Economic analysis, forecasts, and modeling
   - Surveys, data collection, and statistical analysis
   - Impact studies (economic, social, employment)
   - Cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies
   - Regional/sectoral economic development
   - Policy evaluation and recommendations
   
2. **What to SELECT (predict "Yes")**:
   - Tenders about economic/statistical **analysis, studies, research, evaluation**
   - Topics like: labor markets, income, costs, investments, productivity, growth, sectors, regions
   - Surveys or data collection for economic purposes
   - Even if the domain is specialized (e.g., CO2, healthcare, transport), if it requires **economic analysis**, select it

3. **What to REJECT (predict "No")**:
   - Pure IT development/software without research component
   - Construction, infrastructure works without economic analysis
   - Legal services, translations, logistics
   - Training, education delivery (not evaluation)
   - Goods procurement without analysis component

4. **Be inclusive for borderline cases**: If a tender could involve economic research or analysis, lean toward "Yes" with moderate confidence (60-75).

5. **Language-agnostic**: Focus on meaning, not keywords. Tenders in German, French, English, Italian are all valid."""
