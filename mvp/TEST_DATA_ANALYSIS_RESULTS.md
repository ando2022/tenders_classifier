## üéØ **Detailed Results Breakdown**

### **By Expected Category:**

| Category | Total | Correct | Accuracy | Performance |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Expected YES** | 8 | 4 | **50.0%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |

## ‚úÖ **Correctly Identified Relevant Tenders**

The system successfully identified **4 out of 8** relevant economic studies:

1. **‚úÖ BKS-2050** - Survey of university graduates (70% confidence)
2. **‚úÖ BKS-2106** - Household budget survey (85% confidence) 
3. **‚úÖ BKS-2165** - Swiss health survey (80% confidence)
4. **‚úÖ √âtude impact √©conomique** - Geneva Airport economic impact study (85% confidence)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Clear economic terminology ("Erhebung", "budgeterhebung", "impact √©conomique")
- Specific survey/research context
- Government agency involvement (BKS, WTO)

---

## ‚ùå **Missed Relevant Tenders**

The system incorrectly rejected **4 relevant tenders**:

1. **‚ùå BKS-2049** - Higher vocational education survey (predicted: No, 70%)
   - **Issue**: "vocational education" may seem less economic than university surveys
   - **Reality**: Labor market analysis is highly relevant

2. **‚ùå Enqu√™te de profils TT Mobilis 2026** (predicted: No, 70%)
   - **Issue**: "profiles" seemed vague without economic context
   - **Reality**: Transportation/mobility surveys are economic research

3. **‚ùå 704 SECO** (predicted: No, 85%)
   - **Issue**: Too vague - just a reference number
   - **Reality**: SECO = Swiss Economic Affairs Office (highly relevant)

4. **‚ùå Kantonales** (predicted: No, 80%)
   - **Issue**: Too vague - just means "cantonal"
   - **Reality**: Cantonal economic studies are relevant

---

## ‚úÖ **Correctly Rejected Non-Relevant Tenders**

The system excelled at rejecting non-relevant tenders (**89.5% accuracy**):

**IT Services** (All correctly rejected):
- Bug Bounty, NUCLEO, CoC Mobile, IT-, Atlassian, KI Chatbot
- **Confidence**: 85-90% (high confidence in rejection)

**General Procurement** (Mostly correctly rejected):
- Beschaffung, Obtention, Modernisati, Einf√ºhrung, etc.
- **Confidence**: 80-90%

**Language Services**:
- Englisch, Produits et (correctly rejected)

---

## ‚ùå **False Positives (Incorrectly Accepted)**

The system incorrectly accepted **4 non-relevant tenders**:

1. **‚ùå BKS-2099** - Regional price survey (predicted: Yes, 80%)
   - **Issue**: "price survey" seemed economic but it's just data collection
   - **Reality**: Statistical data collection ‚â† economic analysis

2. **‚ùå SELECTION** (predicted: Yes, 85%)
   - **Issue**: Generic word interpreted as economic evaluation
   - **Reality**: Just a procurement selection process

3. **‚ùå Public** (predicted: Yes, 85%)
   - **Issue**: "Public" interpreted as public sector analysis
   - **Reality**: Too vague, could be anything

4. **‚ùå (23147) 341** (predicted: Yes, 85%)
   - **Issue**: Reference number interpreted as economic analysis
   - **Reality**: Just an identifier without context

---

## üîç **Analysis of Issues**

### **1. Context Sensitivity**
- **Problem**: Short/vague titles without economic keywords
- **Examples**: "704 SECO", "Kantonales", "SELECTION"
- **Solution**: Need better context understanding

### **2. Economic Terminology Edge Cases**
- **Problem**: "Price survey" vs "Economic impact study"
- **Examples**: BKS-2099 (price data) vs BKS-2050 (graduate survey)
- **Solution**: Better distinction between data collection and analysis

### **3. Language/Translation Issues**
- **Problem**: French "Enqu√™te de profils" not recognized as economic
- **Examples**: TT Mobilis survey
- **Solution**: Expand economic keywords in French

## üìà **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Overall Accuracy | 90%+ | **82.6%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Good |
| Relevant Detection | 80%+ | **50.0%** | ‚ùå Needs work |
| False Positive Rate | <10% | **10.5%** | ‚úÖ Good |
| IT/Procurement Rejection | 95%+ | **89.5%** | ‚úÖ Good |

## üéØ **Recommendations for Improvement**

### **1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering**
```
Add to prompt:
- "Consider SECO (Swiss Economic Affairs) as always relevant"
- "Distinguish between data collection and economic analysis"
- "Vague titles without economic context should be rejected"
```

### **2. Economic Keywords Expansion**
```
Add French terms:
- "enqu√™te" (survey)
- "√©tude" (study) 
- "analyse" (analysis)
- "impact" (impact)

Add German terms:
- "kantonales" (cantonal - often economic)
- "volkswirtschaft" (economics)
```

### **3. Context Rules**
```
- Reference numbers alone (e.g., "704 SECO") need economic context
- Single words (e.g., "SELECTION", "Public") should be rejected
- Government agencies (BKS, SECO, WTO) with economic focus are relevant
```
