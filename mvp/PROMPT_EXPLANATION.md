## üèóÔ∏è **Prompt Structure**

### **1. Role Definition**
```
You are an expert consultant specializing in public-sector tenders for economic research and analysis.
Your goal is to review a new tender title (and optionally a short summary) and determine if it is a likely match for the client based on the services, keywords, and past selections below.
```

**Purpose**: Establishes the AI's role as a procurement expert for economic research

---

### **2. Client Services Section (Massive - ~100KB)**

The prompt includes **extensive documentation** of BAK Economics' services:

#### **Core Services:**
- **Datenportal**: Economic data portal with Swiss/cantonal/municipal data
- **Konjunkturprognosen**: Economic forecasting (Switzerland & world)
- **Branchenanalyse**: Industry analysis and market potential
- **Life Sciences**: Pharma, biotech, medtech analysis
- **Tourismus Schweiz**: Tourism analysis and forecasting
- **Finanzbranche**: Financial sector analysis
- **Baukonjunktur**: Construction industry forecasting
- **MEM Industrie**: Engineering/machinery analysis
- **Detailhandel**: Retail sector analysis
- **Regionalanalyse**: Regional economic analysis
- **Beratung**: Strategic consulting

#### **Why So Detailed?**
The prompt includes **thousands of words** describing each service area because:
- **Context Understanding**: AI needs to understand BAK's full scope
- **Keyword Recognition**: Helps identify relevant terminology
- **Service Matching**: Connects tender topics to BAK's capabilities

### **3. Decision Rules (The Core Logic)**

```markdown
## Decision rules:
1. **Broad economic research scope**: The client works on:
   - Economic analysis, forecasts, and modeling
   - Surveys, data collection, and statistical analysis
   - Impact studies (economic, social, employment)
   - Cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies
   - Regional/sectoral economic development
   - Policy evaluation and recommendations

2. **What to SELECT (predict "Yes")**:
   - Tenders about economic/statistical **analysis, studies, research, evaluation**
   - Topics like: labor markets, income, costs, investments, productivity, growth, sectors, regions
   - Surveys or data collection for economic purposes
   - Even if the domain is specialized (e.g., CO2, healthcare, transport), if it requires **economic analysis**, select it

3. **What to REJECT (predict "No")**:
   - Pure IT development/software without research component
   - Construction, infrastructure works without economic analysis
   - Legal services, translations, logistics
   - Training, education delivery (not evaluation)
   - Goods procurement without analysis component
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Broad Scope**: Accepts any domain if it involves economic analysis
- **Clear Criteria**: Specific examples of what to accept/reject
- **Domain Agnostic**: Healthcare, transport, etc. are OK if economic analysis is involved

### **4. Output Format (Structured JSON)**

```json
{
  "prediction": "Yes" or "No",
  "confidence_score": <0..100>,
  "reasoning": "<brief one-sentence explanation>"
}
```

**Purpose**: Ensures consistent, parseable output for the system

---

## üîç **How the Prompt Works in Practice**

### **Input Processing:**
1. **Title Analysis**: Primary input (92% accuracy approach)
2. **Context Matching**: Compares against BAK's service areas
3. **Rule Application**: Applies decision rules systematically
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides 0-100% confidence

### **Decision Flow:**
```
Tender Title ‚Üí Service Matching ‚Üí Rule Application ‚Üí Prediction + Reasoning
```

### **Example Analysis:**
```
Input: "BKS-2050 Erhebung bei den Hochschulabsolventinnen"
‚Üì
Service Match: Surveys, data collection (Datenportal section)
‚Üì
Rule Check: "Surveys or data collection for economic purposes" ‚úÖ
‚Üì
Output: {"prediction": "Yes", "confidence": 70%, "reasoning": "..."}
```

## üéØ **Why This Prompt Achieves 92% Accuracy**

### **1. Comprehensive Context**
- **113KB of context** about BAK's services
- **Detailed service descriptions** help AI understand scope
- **Industry-specific terminology** improves recognition

### **2. Clear Decision Rules**
- **Specific criteria** for acceptance/rejection
- **Domain flexibility** (any field + economic analysis = relevant)
- **Clear boundaries** (IT without research = reject)

### **3. Structured Output**
- **JSON format** ensures consistency
- **Confidence scoring** provides uncertainty measure
- **Reasoning requirement** forces thoughtful decisions

### **4. Title-Only Focus**
- **Proven approach**: 92% accuracy vs 88% with full text
- **Reduces noise**: Focuses on core intent
- **Faster processing**: Less tokens, lower cost

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations Identified from Test Results**

### **1. Vague Title Handling**
- **Problem**: "704 SECO", "Kantonales" too ambiguous
- **Solution Needed**: Better context rules for short titles

### **2. French Terminology**
- **Problem**: "Enqu√™te de profils" not recognized
- **Solution Needed**: Expand French economic keywords

### **3. Edge Case Logic**
- **Problem**: "Price survey" vs "Economic impact study" distinction
- **Solution Needed**: Better differentiation rules

---

## üöÄ **Prompt Optimization Opportunities**

### **1. Enhanced Decision Rules**
```markdown
4. **Special Cases**:
   - Government agencies (SECO, BKS, WTO) with economic focus = Always relevant
   - Reference numbers alone (e.g., "704 SECO") need economic context
   - Single words (e.g., "SELECTION", "Public") = Reject (too vague)
```

### **2. Expanded Keywords**
```markdown
5. **Economic Keywords by Language**:
   - German: "Erhebung", "Studie", "Analyse", "Bewertung", "kantonales"
   - French: "enqu√™te", "√©tude", "analyse", "√©valuation", "impact √©conomique"
   - English: "survey", "study", "analysis", "evaluation", "economic impact"
```

### **3. Context Rules**
```markdown
6. **Context Requirements**:
   - Titles < 3 words: Need explicit economic keywords
   - Government agencies: Assume economic relevance unless clearly IT/procurement
   - Surveys: Always relevant if economic/statistical focus
```
