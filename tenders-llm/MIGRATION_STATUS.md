# Historical Experiments - Migration Status

## Current Status: ‚ùå NOT MIGRATED YET

Your previous experiments are **not yet in MLflow**. They exist only as:

1. **JSON files** in `results/`
2. **Manual documentation** in `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`
3. **Prompt archives** in `prompts/archive/`

---

## What Exists Now

### ‚úÖ Documented Historical Experiments

From `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`:

| Exp # | Date | Description | Test Size | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 2024-10-08 | v1 Conservative | 10 (2p/8n) | 80% | N/A | 0% | ‚ùå Failed |
| 2 | 2024-10-08 | v2 Balanced | 50 (23p/27n) | 92% | 95% | 87% | ‚úÖ Best |
| 3a | 2024-10-09 | v2 Title Only | 50 (23p/27n) | 90% | 95% | 83% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 3b | 2024-10-09 | v2 Full Text | 50 (23p/27n) | 88% | 91% | 83% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Worse |

### ‚úÖ Stored Results

```
results/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt_comparison_20251009_090604.json  ‚Üê Experiments 3a & 3b
```

**Contents:**
- Experiment 3a: v2 (Title Only) - Acc 90%, Prec 95%, Rec 83%
- Experiment 3b: v3 (Full Text) - Acc 88%, Prec 91%, Rec 83%

### ‚ùå Missing Data

The following were NOT saved:
- ‚ùå Prediction files (`preds_val.jsonl`, `preds_test.jsonl`)
- ‚ùå PR curve images
- ‚ùå Dataset metadata (what data was used)
- ‚ùå Exact prompt versions used
- ‚ùå Services/keywords versions

**Why this matters:**
Without this data, you can't fully reproduce the experiments or know what changed between runs.

---

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Migrate What Exists (Partial) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

```bash
# Run migration script
python scripts/migrate_historical_experiments.py
```

**This will import:**
- ‚úÖ Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- ‚úÖ Basic parameters (use_full_text, prompt_path)
- ‚úÖ Timestamps
- ‚úÖ Confusion matrix values (TP, FP, TN, FN)

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No data version tracking (data_hash unknown)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No services version tracking (services_hash unknown)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No prompt snapshots (lost to history)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No prediction files (not saved originally)

**Result:**
You'll see all 4 historical experiments in MLflow UI, but with limited detail. They'll be tagged with `migrated=true` to distinguish them from new experiments.

### Option 2: Start Fresh (Clean Slate)

Don't migrate - just start tracking from now on:

```bash
# Your first properly tracked experiment
export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_baseline_with_tracking"
export EXPERIMENT_DESCRIPTION="First experiment with full MLflow tracking"
python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py
```

**Pros:**
- Clean start
- All future experiments fully tracked
- No confusion about incomplete historical data

**Cons:**
- Lose historical comparison
- Can't reference "best ever" from Oct 2024

### Option 3: Recreate Historical Experiments (Time-Intensive)

Manually re-run the historical experiments with full tracking:

```bash
# 1. Restore v2 balanced prompt
cp prompts/archive/v2_classify_tender_balanced_2024-10-08.md prompts/classify_tender.md

# 2. Run with tracking
export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_v2_balanced_recreated"
export EXPERIMENT_DESCRIPTION="Recreation of successful Oct 2024 experiment"
python scripts/04_llm_predict.py
python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py

# 3. Test full text version
export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_v2_fulltext_recreated"
export USE_FULL_TEXT="1"
python scripts/04_llm_predict.py
python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Full tracking (data hash, services hash, etc.)
- ‚úÖ All artifacts saved
- ‚úÖ Reproducible
- ‚úÖ Can validate original results

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Costs money (OpenAI API calls)
- ‚ùå Time consuming (~50 tenders √ó 22 sec = 18+ minutes per experiment)
- ‚ùå Might get slightly different results (model updates, API changes)

## Recommended Approach

**Do Option 1 + Start Fresh**

1. **Migrate what you have** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   python scripts/migrate_historical_experiments.py
   mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlruns/mlflow.db
   # View historical experiments in UI
   ```

2. **Document the baseline** (2 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Note in EXPERIMENT_LOG.md that historical data is partial
   echo "Note: Experiments 1-3 migrated to MLflow with limited metadata" >> EXPERIMENT_LOG.md
   ```

3. **Start proper tracking** (now):
   ```bash
   export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_$(date +%Y%m%d)_baseline"
   export EXPERIMENT_DESCRIPTION="First experiment with complete tracking"
   python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py
   ```

**Result:**
- You have historical context (4 past experiments)
- All future experiments fully tracked
- Clear distinction between old (partial) and new (complete) tracking

## Decision Time

Choose your path:

**A) Quick Migration (5 min)**
```bash
python scripts/migrate_historical_experiments.py
```

**B) Skip Migration (0 min)**
```bash
# Just start fresh from now
export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_first_tracked"
python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py
```

**C) Full Recreation (2-4 hours + $$$)**
```bash
# Re-run historical experiments with full tracking
# See "Option 3" above
```

## Questions?

- **"Will I lose my historical data if I don't migrate?"**
  No! It's still in `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` and `results/`. Migration just makes it easier to compare.

- **"Can I migrate later?"**
  Yes! The migration script can be run anytime.

- **"What if I run new experiments before migrating?"**
  No problem! Historical and new experiments will coexist in MLflow.

- **"Should I migrate even with incomplete data?"**
  Yes, if you want to compare new results against old baselines in one UI. Otherwise, start fresh.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose migration approach** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Run migration** (if chosen)
3. **Start MLflow UI:**
   ```bash
   mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlruns/mlflow.db
   ```
4. **Run first properly tracked experiment:**
   ```bash
   export EXPERIMENT_NAME="exp_baseline_full_tracking"
   python scripts/05_eval_with_mlflow.py
   ```
5. **Compare in UI** and celebrate having full tracking! üéâ
