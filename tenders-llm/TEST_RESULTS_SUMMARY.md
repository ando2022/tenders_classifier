# Test Results Summary - October 9, 2025

## üéØ Key Finding: The Prompt Was the Problem, Not the Extraction Method

### Experiment Results

**Test 1: Conservative Prompt**
- All methods: 95% accuracy, **0% recall** ‚ùå
- Missed the 1 positive case (economics evaluation tender)
- Model too afraid to predict "Yes"

**Test 2: Balanced Prompt** ‚≠ê
- All methods: **100% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall** ‚úÖ
- Caught the positive case correctly!
- No false positives

## üìä Comparison Table

### Conservative Prompt ("avoid over-inclusive Yes")
| Method | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | Result |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|
| Title Only | 95% | 0% | 0% | 0.000 | ‚ùå Too cautious |
| XML Description | 95% | 0% | 0% | 0.000 | ‚ùå Too cautious |
| XML Desc+Deliv | 95% | 0% | 0% | 0.000 | ‚ùå Too cautious |

### Balanced Prompt (Removed "avoid over-inclusive")
| Method | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | Result |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|
| Title Only | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1.000 | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| XML Description | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1.000 | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| XML Desc+Deliv | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1.000 | ‚úÖ Perfect |

## üîç The Missed Case (ID 4629)

**Tender:** "Evaluation der nach der Aufhebung der Ausfuhrbeitr√§ge eingef√ºhrten Begleitmassnahmen"  
(Evaluation of measures introduced after abolition of export subsidies)

**Why it's relevant:**
- It's an economic policy evaluation
- Requires economic analysis expertise
- Fits BAK Economics services perfectly

**Conservative prompt reasoning:**
> "Evaluating export measures does not align closely with economic research services"

**Balanced prompt reasoning:**
> (Would predict "Yes" - aligns with evaluation services)

**Conclusion:** The prompt's conservative wording made the model reject valid economic research tenders!

## ‚úÖ XML Extraction Verification

### What Was Tested

**3 Extraction Methods:**

1. **Title Only (Baseline)**
   - Input: Just tender title (150 chars)
   
2. **XML Description (Section 2.6)**
   - Input: Title + extracted project description (700 chars)
   - Extracts: CONT.DESCR, CONT.NAME
   
3. **XML Relevant Sections (2.6 + 3.7 + 3.8)**
   - Input: Title + project scope + suitability criteria (1000+ chars)
   - Extracts: CONT.DESCR, LOT.DESCR, OB01.COND.TECHNICAL, OB01.COND.PROOF

### Extraction Quality

**Verified working:**
- ‚úÖ Parses XML correctly
- ‚úÖ Extracts SIMAP sections 2.6, 3.7, 3.8
- ‚úÖ Removes boilerplate (addresses, legal text, payment terms)
- ‚úÖ Reduces from 17,000+ chars ‚Üí 700-2,000 chars (focused content)

**Example extraction:**
```
Original XML: 5,359 chars (with addresses, legal, etc.)
Extracted description: 717 chars (just project description)
Noise removed: 4,642 chars (87%)
```

## üéØ Conclusions

### Finding #1: Prompt Quality > Extraction Method

**Impact:**
- Conservative prompt: 0% recall (misses positives)
- Balanced prompt: 100% recall (catches positives)

**Lesson:** Fix the prompt before worrying about extraction!

### Finding #2: XML Extraction Works

**What it does:**
- Successfully extracts relevant SIMAP sections
- Removes 80-90% of boilerplate
- Provides focused project descriptions

**But:** On the 20-case sample, all methods performed identically with the balanced prompt.

### Finding #3: Title-Only Still Competitive

**On this 20-case sample:**
- Title-only: 100% accuracy
- XML extraction: 100% accuracy (same)

**Why?**
- Sample is small (only 1 positive)
- Balanced prompt is good enough
- Titles are already informative

## üí° Next Steps

### What We've Established

‚úÖ **Balanced prompt works** (100% on dev sample)
‚úÖ **XML extraction implemented** (sections 2.6, 3.7, 3.8)
‚úÖ **Rapid testing pipeline** (10 min per experiment)

### What We Still Don't Know

‚ùì Does XML extraction help on **larger samples** (50-100 cases)?
‚ùì Does it help with **edge cases** (vague titles)?
‚ùì What's the **real baseline** on full validation set?

### Recommended Next Experiments

1. **Test on larger sample (50 cases)** to see if differences emerge
2. **Focus on edge cases** where title is ambiguous
3. **Track costs** - is extra context worth the token cost?
